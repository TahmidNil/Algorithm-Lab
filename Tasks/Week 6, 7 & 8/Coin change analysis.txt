Coin change analysis:

we need to sort the array of coins of size n, which complexity is o(nlogn).
Then assigning the coins take O(n) so over all complexity becomes O(nlogn)+O(n).
To store the coins,we need array of size n. so,space complexity is O(n).

Knapsack problem analysis:

First of all we need to sort the array of items of complexity is (On2).
Then taking the item with O(n),so overall the complexity is O(n2)+O(n).
To store the item we need to array of size n. so space complexity is O(n).
